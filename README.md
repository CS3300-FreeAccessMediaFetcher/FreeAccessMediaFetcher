## DEBUG - Running App Locally
Follow these steps to start the app for local debugging:

- Install **Flask** on your machine or in a virtual Python environment using pip
- Run **flask_server.py** (this will start the web server on your local machine)
- Open a web browser and navigate to **localhost:3000**

When making changes, be sure to quit the app and re-run to see those changes reflected in Flask.
